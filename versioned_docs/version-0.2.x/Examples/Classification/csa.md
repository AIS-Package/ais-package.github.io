### Binary Algorithm

+ [Example with random samples](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/classification/AIRS/example_with_randomly_generated_dataset-en.ipynb) 
> In the example present in this notebook 1000 random samples were generated, arranged in two groups, one for each class.

+ [mushrooms_dataBase_example](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/classification/AIRS/mushrooms_dataBase_example_en.ipynb)
>  It uses the [mushrooms database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom), which contains information about edible and poisonous mushrooms.

### Real-Valued Algorithm

+ [Example with random samples](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/classification/AIRS/example_with_randomly_generated_dataset-en.ipynb) 
> In the example present in this notebook 500 random samples were generated, arranged in two groups, one for each class, we can see the non-self detectors generated below
+ [iris_dataBase_example](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/classification/AIRS/iris_dataBase_example_en.ipynb)
> Example using the NSA [iris database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains four-dimensional samples and three output classes (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica).
+ [geyser_dataBase_example](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/classification/AIRS/geyser_dataBase_example_en.ipynb)
> To classify geyser eruptions in Yellowstone National Park, this notebook uses the [Old Faithful database](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/geyser.csv).

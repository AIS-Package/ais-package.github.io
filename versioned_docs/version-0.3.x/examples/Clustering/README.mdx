# Clustering

Access the notebooks with the option to run them online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AIS-Package/aisp/HEAD?labpath=%2Fexamples%2Fen%2Fclustering)


---

## The examples are organized below:

### Data Normalization
> It presents the use of the original (non-normalized) data and demonstrates how to normalize it between 0 and 1
> using MinMaxScaler, preparing the dataset for training and enhancing clustering performance.

### Training Model
> Initializes and trains the model, identifies clusters, and evaluates clustering quality using metrics such as
> Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).

### Visualizing Clusters
> Visualizes the formed clusters, the antibody population, and the immune network.

## Introduction

The **AISP** is a python module that implements artificial immune systems techniques, distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3).

The package started in **2022** as a research project at the Federal Institute of Northern Minas Gerais - Salinas campus (**IFNMG - Salinas**).


Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are inspired by the vertebrate immune system, creating metaphors that apply the ability to detect and catalog pathogens, among other features of this system.

### Algorithms implemented:

> - [x] [**Negative Selection.**](./aisp-techniques/Negative%20Selection/)
> - [ ] *Dendritic Cells.*
> - [ ] *Clonalg.*
> - [ ] *Immune Network Theory.*

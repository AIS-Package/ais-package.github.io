## Introduction

**AISP** is a Python package of immunoinspired techniques that apply metaphors from the vertebrate immune system to pattern recognition and optimization tasks. Conceived as an open-source package of artificial immune systems, AISP emerged from a research project initiated in **2022** at the Instituto Federal do Norte de Minas Gerais - Campus Salinas (**IFNMG - Salinas**). Its distribution is governed by the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3).

### Algorithms implemented:

> - [ ] *Dendritic Cells.*
> - [ ] *Clonal Selection Algorithms.*
> - [ ] *Immune Network Theory.*

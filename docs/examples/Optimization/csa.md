## Clonalg (Clonal Selection Algorithm)

+ [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/optimization/clonalg/tsp_problem_example.ipynb)
> In this notebook, apply **Clonalg** to the Knapsack Problem using optimization algorithms from the AISP package.


+ [Rastrigin Function](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/optimization/clonalg/rastrigin_function_example.ipynb)
> In this notebook, we apply **Clonalg** to the **Rastrigin Function**, a classic continuous optimization problem using optimization algorithms from the **AISP** package.


+ [Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/AIS-Package/aisp/blob/main/examples/en/optimization/clonalg/knapsack_problem_example.ipynb)
> In this notebook, apply **Clonalg** to the Knapsack Problem using optimization algorithms from the AISP package.

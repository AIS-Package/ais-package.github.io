## ABR (Artificial Recognition Ball)

Individual from the set of recognizing cells (ABR), inherits characteristics from a B-cell, adding resource consumption

:::info

**``ABR``** extends the **[``Cell`` class](../cell)**, inheriting its base functionality.

:::

### Constructor:

Parameters:
* vector (``npt.NDArray``): A feature vector of the cell. Defaults to None.

---

### Function consume_resource(...):

Parameters:
* n_resource (```float```) : The initial amount of resources.
* amplified (``float``): Amplifier for resource consumption by the cell. It is multiplied by the cell's stimulus. The default value is 1.

```python
def consume_resource(self, n_resource: float, amplified: float = 1) -> float:
```

Returns the remaining amount of resources after consumption.
